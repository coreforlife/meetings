# Program - Computational Proteomics Session

Dates: from 2019-10-07 to 2019-10-09

Computational Proteomics Sessions: 

# 12-13h WG Session 2B: Bioinformatics C4L Parallel Session I ("Barceloneta" Training Room)

* Small update/introduction from each node (5 min). 
* Short presentations (10 min aprox.) regarding some specific topics like: 
    * QCloud API (@mserret). 
    * C4L R package (@cpanse).
    * PDF weekly reports (@anstaes). 
* Discussion. 

# 15-17h WG Session 4B: Bioinformatics C4L Parallel Session II ("Barceloneta" Training Room)

* Discussion (follow up). 
* Hands on: 
    * @cpanse @rolivella: hands-on explore a potential integration of [rawDiag](https://github.com/fgcz/rawDiag) within the [QCloud](http://qcloud2.crg.eu).

# Action points:

CRG: 

* Improve isotopologues extraction with XIC algorithm.
* Publish QCloud C4L API to production server with accessible ports from outside the CRG. 
* Make simple R snippets for accessing QCloud2 API.  
* Add to QCloud C4L Orbitrap Fusion Lumos 1 and 2 (from June) from the VIB. 
* Evaluate QCloud API annotations insertion. 
* Num. of proteins and peptides (and maybe also LVN Peptide Area) available on Telegram bot. 

VIB: 

* Use the QCloud C4L API to generate the weekly PDF report instead of CSV files.
* Improve outliers management in the weekly PDF report (by using Boxplots, ...). 
* Link pointing to all past PDF reports. (VIB)
* Check why the file lastreport.pdf is not updated every week though the current PDF file is actually generated (i.e. c4l-hs-week-20190930-20191006_Report.pdf).
