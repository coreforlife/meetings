	- razor peptides in FragPipe.
	- spectro mine (DDA/TMT); cmd option non-free;
	- fragpipe >v19
	- ppms for instrument booking
	- p: qc-plots; throughout (20min)

CJ
	- New group leader
	- Renaming into Computational ...
	- Ongoing efforts for imaging, single cell
	- New building 
	- Started DIA (DiaNN commandline) 
	- Fragpipe-TMT
	- html reporting
	- new searchengine-DAE applications, with fragpipe/MQ+prolfqua-SAINT

Workload
	- EMBL and DKFZ have one bioinformatician doing data analysis. THe others have 2 on average.
	- FGCZ has highest throughput in terms of # projects and # pulications. Muc larger team as well.
	- Projects/paper ratio discussed. 

Spectronaut/DIANN:
	W 15min
	G 15min
	discussion 20min
	

QC-plot session:

FS
	- Includes QC plots for TMT and fractionation
	- peptide nb and intensity along the analytical run
	- they also have PTM experiment QC plots

Q
	- Based on PTXQC
	- several dendrograms to show sample similarity (e.g. protein ID overlapping)
	
T
M
- PTM
- missing values heatmap
- stacked barplot with # modified residues


Common plots:
- sample intensity dists
- sample correlation heatmaps
- ID rates
- PCAs



special topics: 
	- PTM 
	- differnt stradegies
	- normalization
	- MSStats PTM adjusted fc
	- MSqRob PTM
	- 
	
Interesting integrative new tool for downstream analysis
