# Program - Computational Proteomics Session


Dates: from 2025-05-08 to 2024-05-10<br>


## topics :

### CRG by @rolivella

* Report: CRG installation of the QSample at VIB..
* New `atlas` pipeline written in Nextflow for both QCloud and QSample. New optimizations and algorithms. New nucleosides quality control or QCN1.  
* Rawstream project: a structured set of scripts written in bash to send DIA-NN process to a cluster for hundreds of RAW files. Here we can also discuss a similar joint project from VIB and FGCZ. 
* [Integrative Bioinformatics 2024, 18th International Symposium, Zurich 12./13. September 2024](http://ib2024.ch). We can discuss if we want to present some of our work there. From our side, we will present something TBD, maybe with the collaboration of the Bioinformatics Core Facility here at the CRG.  
* Case study: [Globus upload to PRIDE](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/markdownpage/globus) for the C4L harmonization study (4.6 TB). Here we can also discuss/share regular uploads issues (ports, protocols, etc.).
