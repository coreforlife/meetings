# Program - Computational Proteomics Session


Dates: from 2025-05-08 to 2024-05-10<br>


## topics :

### CRG by @rolivella

* New `atlas` pipeline written in Nextflow for both QCloud and QSample. New optimizations and algorithms. New nucleosides quality control or QCN1. Improve documentation: Teresa and Roger. 
* Rawstream project: a structured set of scripts written in bash to send DIA-NN process to a cluster for hundreds of RAW files. Here we can also discuss a similar joint project from VIB and FGCZ. 
* Case study: [Globus upload to PRIDE](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/markdownpage/globus) for the C4L harmonization study (4.6 TB). Here we can also discuss/share regular uploads issues (ports, protocols, etc.). 

### FGCZ by @cpanse
* [![SIB in-silico talk](https://img.youtube.com/vi/acDiXq2xbOw/1.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acDiXq2xbOw)
* [proteoBench for C4L Challenge](http://fgcz-ms.uzh.ch/~cpanse/202403_C4LChallengeProject-proteomics-proteoBench.pdf)  - 2nd call! - kickoff meeting?
* update compMSI @fgcz
* https://bioconductor.org/packages/rawDiag/ version 0.99.31 with shiny module
* http://ib2024.ch 

### PCF by @fstein
* Discussion about DIA-NN and Fragpipe/DIA-NN
* Discussion about best-practice QC for DIA data
* Comparison of TMT and DIA on same samples
* News on FragPipeCommandeR

### DKFZ by Martin
* Is anyone interested in sharing and discussing Spectronaut settings?
* Has someone used missRanger, the fast version of missforest and knows if they yield equivalent results?
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/missRanger/vignettes/missRanger.html
* AlphaPept v0.5.0 on Linux cluster first insights (open source makes it possible)
* Analysis optimization with HYE and fade-in fade-out, additional thoughts

### IMP by Gerhard
* Observations from DIA analysis in Spectronaut
