# Proteobench brainstorm

- Dataset: HYE on Astral
- measures at protein level
- # peptides / protein
- peptide ids vs abundance (after jaccard ) 
- abundance distribution of peptides
- precursor intensity (average) histogram of frequency
- precursor intensity on x and % of search analysis that got it (per raw file)
- histogram of intensities (color per analysis) (venn for each bin)

- how much each software digs in the noise
- noise on and off (limit of detection)

- cv () what is reported.
- roc curve with logfc
- 
cv vs abundance 
missingness vs abundance

Heatmap of QC measures with possibility to assign weights to each. Ideally there should be possibility to visualize the data in few key plots.
